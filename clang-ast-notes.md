[“clang-useful: Building useful tools with LLVM and clang for fun and profit"](https://youtu.be/E6i8jmiy8MY)

## Types

- Stmt (statement)
  - examples: if
- Decl (declaration)
  - examples: class, variable, function, enum, values, names,fields, variables
- Expr (expression)
  - derives from statement
- Type (types)
  - type declaration
  - qual type - includes const and volatile specifiers

## Clang Tooling

- libClang (c interface)
  - stable api
- libTooling

### libClang

- cursors - a pointer to a node
- no base class for all types of nodes (no AST node)
- in C++ visitation class is used
- has built in code completion
  - codeCompleteAt (insert a special marker in the AST)
- has a pythonAPI
- very high level
- usually easier to achieve things with libClang

### libTooling

- c++ library
- more powerful
  - clang tidy
    - could add a new plugin to clang-tidy
  - clang plugin
    - dynamic libraries that you build and link into clang when you run it
    - could put it into your build tool, check for linter errorsetc
  - clang tool
    - standalone executable with clang as a library
    - has a main function
    - more power

## Info

- AST Dump - dump out whole AST

## Demo/Example

- Create an index (`CIIndex`) - a structure that will manage all your translation units for you
- `clang_parseTranslationUnit` - important function, gives you back the AST (does all the parsing)
- `CXTranslationUnit` - cursor as well
- `clang_visitChildren` - does the actual visitation (walks the AST)
  - takes `data` (`void*`) data includes filter and the lines (includes some predicates)
  - pattern (regular expression)
  - `clang_getCursorKind` - kind of cursor (e.g. filter for functions)
    - every cursor has a _kind_ - it is the c abstraction for _decl_, _statement_, _expression_ etc...
  - `clang_Location_isInSystemHeader` - to skip all system headers
  - `clang_getCursorSpelling` - name of the function/class
  - `clang_getSpellingLocation` - find where in the file is this cursor, returns line number, column number and file
  - `CXChildVisit_Recurse` - continue recursing AST
  - `CXChildVisit_Continue` - continue to the next sibling
  - `CXChildVisit_Break` - stop at this point
- libtooling
  - clang tool is made up of three things, an __Action__, a __Consumer__ and a __Callback__
  - an __Action__ allows you to access the AST at different steps during the compilation
    - e.g. `BeginSourceFileAction` - access file name among other things
    - also `EndSourceFileAction` and `ExecuteAction` (in between)
      - can print something at the end
    - __Consumer__ - little boilerplate, creates a matcher - good at finding a specific node in the AST
      - has macros where you can define what you're looking for (e.g. functions)
      - `HandleTranslationUnit` - run our handler on the AST
    - At this point the AST is already parsed
    - Handler - called for every node that matches
    - mccabe index example
    - `buildCFG` - builds a graph consisting of basic blocks
      - computer number of nodes and edges
    - clang Diagnostics (can use for your own tool) - [Emitting Diagnostics in Clang](http://www.goldsborough.me/c++/clang/llvm/tools/2017/02/24/00-00-06-emitting_diagnostics_and_fixithints_in_clang_tools/)
      - create a diagnostics engine in clang
  - include sorting (using the preprocessor)
    - `BeginInvokeAction` - called before any source file is touched
    - can override `InclusionDirective` in class deriving from `clang::PPCallbacks`
    - `Rewriter.ReplaceText` - begin/end
    - `clang::FixItHint` - describe some way of fixing a problem

## Closing

- `clangd` - language server (clang as a service)
  - code completion, linting etc...
